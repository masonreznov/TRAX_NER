## TRAX_NER -- Named Entity Recognition with LSTM network using TRAX library
This repo contains the implementation for named entity recognition (NER) using TRAX library. The implementation is based upon the programming assignment of Natural Language Processing with Sequence Model from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp).


### Requirements
- [trax 1.3.x](https://github.com/google/trax)
- [pandas 1.1.x](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
